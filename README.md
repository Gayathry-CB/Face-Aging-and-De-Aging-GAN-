## **Face Aging and De-Aging using GAN (CycleGAN)**

## Description

This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) to perform facial age progression and regression. The model transforms input facial images
into aged or de-aged versions while preserving identity.

## Features

- Real-time image input and result preview
- Trained on UTKFace dataset
- CycleGAN-based age transformation
- Integrated with Python Flask for UI

## Dataset

- **UTKFace Dataset**  
  Contains over 20,000 face images labeled with age, gender, and ethnicity.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8  
- PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- CycleGAN  
- Flask (for web interface)  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Model Training

- Used image pairs for aging and de-aging
- Implemented CycleGAN with ResNet generators
- Trained using custom preprocessing pipeline and loss functions

## How to run
  - Run the app.py  python code on your device (either on vs code or any other platform)
